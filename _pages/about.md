i-MemTec Lab Mission:
======
The Innovation in Membrane Technology for Circular Economy (i-MemTec) Lab aims to pioneer advanced membrane technology for a circular economy of nutrients, energy, and water (NEW) resources.

Ongoing Research Efforts:
======
1. Design and fabrication of functional membrane materials, and mechanistic understanding of membrane formation and transport phenomena.
2. Development and optimization of membrane processes for water purification, emerging contamination treatment, and resource recovery.
3. Circularity in desalination membrane materials.

We are hiring new Ph.D. students and Postdocs!
======
Prospective students are encouraged to send the following materials as a single PDF file with the email subject “PhD/Postdoc application – Your name” to Prof. Liang at yuanzhe.liang@oregonstate.edu:
