## Multiple Ph.D. Student and Postdoctoral Research Associate Opportunities in the School of Chemical, Biological and Environmental Engineering at Oregon State University

## Position Description

The School of Chemical, Biological and Environmental Engineering (CBEE) at Oregon State University invites applications for 2-3 Ph.D. student positions and 1 postdoctoral research associate position, starting winter 2023, spring or Fall 2024. The successful candidate will conduct research on one of the following research topics: (1) design and fabrication of functional membrane materials, and mechanistic understanding of membrane formation and transport phenomena, (2) development and optimization of membrane processes for water purification, emerging contamination treatment, and resource recovery, (3) circularity in desalination membrane materials. The Ph.D. students will be fully supported with salary, tuition, and health insurance. The initial appointment of the postdoctoral research associate is 1 year, with the possibility of extension depending on mutual satisfaction.

## Application Procedure
Prospective students are encouraged to send the following materials as a single PDF file with the email subject “PhD/Postdoc application – Your name” to Dr. Yuanzhe Liang at yuanzhe.liang@oregonstate.edu:
1.	A cover letter describing your background, relevant experience, and future career plan. (1 page)
2.	C.V.
3.	Copies of transcripts (unofficial)
4.	Scientific writing samples if any (e.g., first-author papers)
5.	Three suggested references including their emails.<br>
The review process will begin immediately and continue until the positions are filled.

## Candidate Qualification

## Ph.D. position:
1.	Self-motivated candidates with a bachelor’s degree in material science & engineering, polymer science & engineering, environmental engineering, chemical engineering, chemistry, or closely related fields are particularly encouraged to apply.  
2.	A master’s degree with research experience is highly desirable but not required. 
3.	Previous research experiences with membranes, polymers, nanomaterials, catalysis, electrochemistry, transport modeling, and/or data science will be favorable. 
4.	Good verbal and writing communication skills as well as the ability to work independently will also be highly valued in the review process.

## Postdoctoral research associate position:
1.	Ph.D. in material science & engineering, polymer science & engineering, environmental engineering, chemical engineering, chemistry, or closely related fields.
2.	Demonstrated knowledge and expertise in membrane materials synthesis and characterization, membrane process development, waste polymer recycling, catalytic biomass conversion, life cycle assessment, techno-economic assessment and/or programming and machine learning with a demonstrated publication record in these areas.
3.	Excellent verbal and writing skills.
4.	Ability to mentor graduate students and manage projects.
